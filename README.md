# **Line Monitor**: A Line Balancing and Optimization Program

This was an individual project for an object-oriented programming with python course (ITSS 4381) taught by professor Vatsal Maru during fall of 2023.
The project was motivated by my industry experience as a production line manager, who often had to deal with line optimization and balancing.
The goal of this program is to automate large part of such task to save time.
